<h1>Wireless Network</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The objective of this Project is to establish a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) infrastructure at Tri-Arrow Printing's corporate headquarter and remote printing facilities, with the aim of generating a significant return on investment while contributing to the community. The department utilizes advanced printing technologies and other cutting-edge devices to deliver bespoke designs tailored to clients' distinct requirements, necessitating the implementation of security protocols across all devices and the incorporation of wireless handsets to enhance network coverage. Based on expert insights from the IT profession, it is highly recommended to introduce an 802.11n-/802.11ac network.

<p>It's asolutely necessary to understand the need for the implementation of an 802.11 network. An 802.11 standard WLAN will not only securely benefit Tri-Arrow printing now, but also in the future for further expansion. Tri-Arrow is all about being fast and efficient and in order to fully maximize efficiency, a network designed with 802.11 standards is necessary. Some things to keep in mind for this implantation are the equipment, the benefits, and also the costs that will be discussed further below.</p>
<p>Integration and Updates:
Before implementing 802.11 standards in the Tri-Arrow network, the company will first have to look at removing proprietary standards, as using these are only single vendor specific, making the network less efficient. The goal is to upgrade new equipment and software for a more secure network overall, and better protection for customers. </p>
<p>Versatile Information Process:
Our network needs an 802.11 upgrade to better support our customers' needs and improve wireless communication. By implementing these standards, the network will perform at its best. </p>
<p>Collaboration:
The new 802.11 wireless network will enhance our printing department by offering high-speed connections and improved security for customer information. Even though Tri-Arrow is a small company, we have plans to expand, making the upgrade necessary. </p>
<p>Scalability:
The implementation of 802.11 standards will benefit our current employees without much adaptation required. The IT department will need to understand the importance of this upgrade and communicate it to staff. </p> 
<p>Intended Users:
The printing employees will benefit the most from the new 802.11 standards. The upgrade will improve their speed and efficiency by installing wireless access points and providing wireless IP phones for client communication. </p>
<p>Design Assumptions:
The use of proprietary standards in our current devices presents a challenge for the implementation of 802.11 standards. We will need to ensure compatibility with all devices to avoid erasing the entire network. </p>
<p>Equipment Needs and Proposed Budget: 
To implement the 802.11 wireless standards, we will need new equipment, including wireless phones, tablets, access points, switches, and PoE equipment. The cost will be around $200,000-$300,000, but our plans for growth and profitability make this investment worthwhile. </p>
