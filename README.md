<h1>Wireless Network</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
The objective of this Project is to establish a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) infrastructure at Tri-Arrow Printing's corporate headquarter and remote printing facilities, with the aim of generating a significant return on investment while contributing to the community. The department utilizes advanced printing technologies and other cutting-edge devices to deliver bespoke designs tailored to clients' distinct requirements, necessitating the implementation of security protocols across all devices and the incorporation of wireless handsets to enhance network coverage. Based on expert insights from the IT profession, it is highly recommended to introduce an 802.11n-/802.11ac network.

<h2>Objectives of the Network</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WmgESTH.png" height="80%" width="80%"
<p>It's asolutely necessary to understand the need for the implementation of an 802.11 network. An 802.11 standard WLAN will not only securely benefit Tri-Arrow printing now, but also in the future for further expansion. Tri-Arrow is all about being fast and efficient and in order to fully maximize efficiency, a network designed with 802.11 standards is necessary. Some things to keep in mind for this implantation are the equipment, the benefits, and also the costs that will be discussed further below.</p>
<p>Integration and Updates:
Before implementing 802.11 standards in the Tri-Arrow network, the company will first have to look at removing proprietary standards, as using these are only single vendor specific, making the network less efficient. The goal is to upgrade new equipment and software for a more secure network overall, and better protection for customers. </p>
<p>Versatile Information Process:
Our network needs an 802.11 upgrade to better support our customers' needs and improve wireless communication. By implementing these standards, the network will perform at its best. </p>
<p>Collaboration:
The new 802.11 wireless network will enhance our printing department by offering high-speed connections and improved security for customer information. Even though Tri-Arrow is a small company, we have plans to expand, making the upgrade necessary. </p>
<p>Scalability:
The implementation of 802.11 standards will benefit our current employees without much adaptation required. The IT department will need to understand the importance of this upgrade and communicate it to staff. </p> 
<p>Intended Users:
The printing employees will benefit the most from the new 802.11 standards. The upgrade will improve their speed and efficiency by installing wireless access points and providing wireless IP phones for client communication. </p>
<p>Design Assumptions:
The use of proprietary standards in our current devices presents a challenge for the implementation of 802.11 standards. We will need to ensure compatibility with all devices to avoid erasing the entire network. </p>
<p>Equipment Needs and Proposed Budget: 
To implement the 802.11 wireless standards, we will need new equipment, including wireless phones, tablets, access points, switches, and PoE equipment. The cost will be around $200,000-$300,000, but our plans for growth and profitability make this investment worthwhile. </p>
 
<h2>Network Needs Analysis </h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eZYpfvs.png" height="80%" width="80%"
<p>Data Types: Tri-Arrow must ensure that customer information, including personal and customizable details, remains confidential and is exclusively shared between the network and clients. Implementing 802.11 on all devices ensures safe communication and storage of this data. </p>
<p>Data Sources: To ensure customer data is securely stored, Tri-Arrow uses a cloud application software called Pipedrive, which places customer data in a separate and private database for protection. WPA 3 standards are also implemented to ensure encryption from outside traffic. </p>
<p>Number of Users that will need to be supported: As Tri-Arrow plans to expand into remote locations, they should plan for more employees to use the network. The network will also need to handle about 5000 customer users per year. </p>
<p>Speed Requirements: High-speed ethernet connections are necessary for employees to complete projects on the network's high-quality printers. Wireless printers will connect over 5GHz wifi, but ethernet will be used for large projects.</p>
<p>Load Variation Estimates: Approximately 45,000Kps of bandwidth will be used daily for employee wireless phones, while customer usage will use approximately 160,000Mbps annually. Tri-Arrow employees will use around 5,170Mbps per day based on a bandwidth estimator calculation. </p>


<h2>QoS Requirements: </h2>

<p>A Quality of Service (QoS) implementation will prioritize important tasks like phone calls and video meetings at Tri-Arrow, preventing network traffic from causing call disruption or lag. To ensure wireless phones are always available to customers, Tri-Arrow should configure VLANs for VoIPs, use WPA2 encryption, and implement 802.11r standards for roaming. As Tri-Arrow expands, their IT team must monitor network utilization and maintain network control as new devices are added with various protocols and security measures to ensure efficiency.</p>

<h2>Reliability and Security Requirements:</h2>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JavPEXU.png" height="80%" width="80%"
<p>Reliability Requirements: Expectations of the updated Tri-Arrow network include higher reliability and faster speeds, but not all devices have equal data speeds in a wireless network. To maximize the 802.11 installation, the organization needs to purchase the appropriate equipment, such as Cisco wireless phones with equal capabilities, and ensure that other network equipment meets specific requirements. The implementation of 802.11 also provides enhanced Wi-Fi security through WPA2 encryption and authentication for all wireless clients, but Tri-Arrow must also incorporate other security measures such as VPNs, password policies, specified administrator privileges, and consistent security policy enforcement.</p>
<p>Security Requirements: Tri-Arrow is required to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which is one of the most significant laws that protects consumers and mandates that businesses handling credit card information follow certain guidelines. To ensure compliance, Tri-Arrow must securely destroy personal information related to customers when it is no longer necessary, as retaining it unnecessarily could result in severe financial consequences and potential legal action. Additionally, it is highly recommended that Tri-Arrow establish a robust detection and response program to efficiently respond to identity theft attacks in case they occur. With the amount of customer information Tri-Arrow handles, taking these security measures seriously is crucial to avoid potential lawsuits and federal charges.</p>

<p>The initial diagram presented demonstrates a clear representation of the wireless network implementation for Tri-Arrow, which incorporates the 802.11 standard. In addition, it highlights the requirement for printers to be installed in various departments across the organization, as indicated in red.</p>


<h2>Diagram 2:</h2>

<p>The presented diagram provides an overview of Tri-Arrow's network infrastructure, although it does not account for the incorporation of 802.11 or other wireless technologies. At present, with a staff of only 30 employees, the current number of printers is sufficient to meet the company's needs, and no additional printers need to be procured. In line with Tri-Arrow's two-year growth strategy, the diagram includes the anticipated number of printing stations at each location, as well as one extra printer per site. Tri-Arrow can consider purchasing more printers in the future if the workforce expands, and production efficiency decreases.</p>
